## **Ethics and legality of wastewater pathogen surveillance**

The legal concept of wastewater, while exhibiting variations in its precise definitional parameters and wording across jurisdictions, demonstrates remarkable consistency across regulatory frameworks in environmental and public health statutory instruments. The contemporary legal definitions encompass "water that has been adversely affected in quality by anthropogenic influence," a formulation that necessarily encompasses domestic sewage originating from residential and institutional sources, industrial effluent discharged through commercial operations, urban stormwater runoff precipitated by meteorological events, and, within certain regulatory contexts, specialized waste streams including sludge and greywater systems.

Wastewater can be used for a broad range of public health monitoring purposes, including tracking of the prevalence and evolution of pathogen species via wastewater. Over recent years, wastewater monitoring has most commonly been used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 trends, and has been shown to enable surveillance of a broad range of pathogens and in a variety of contexts, from large urban environments to the level of individual buildings. As these represent a wide range of use cases that provide correspondingly diverse information about the population of interest, it is essential to consider the unique ethical and legal considerations of different surveillance approaches.

International legal instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), enshrine fundamental principles that guide surveillance practices, including the protection of individual privacy under Articles 12 and 17, respectively, ensuring that surveillance practices do not undermine human rights and ethical standards.bIn the context of public health surveillance, the WHO Ethical Guidelines for Public Health Surveillance (2017) further elaborate on these principles, emphasizing that surveillance must be necessary, proportionate, and publicly accountable. These guidelines stress that data collection methods must serve legitimate public health objectives, be justified by significant benefits, and include safeguards to prevent misuse or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) operates within a legal landscape characterized not by prohibitive regulatory barriers, but rather by a complex matrix of regulatory lacunae that, paradoxically, facilitates rather than impedes implementation. Our comprehensive analysis encompassing ten major jurisdictions reveals that the absence of specific WBS legislation, rather than constituting an impediment, has enabled jurisdictions to implement comprehensive surveillance programs through the strategic deployment of existing public health authorities. Privacy considerations, while frequently articulated as potential impediments to WBS implementation, have proven largely unfounded upon rigorous legal analysis. Aggregated sewage data, by virtue of its inherent anonymization and population-level aggregation, typically fails to satisfy the definitional requirements for personal information under established data protection regimes, thereby obviating individual consent requirements while maintaining compliance with privacy legislation. Public health practitioners can therefore proceed with confidence in establishing WBS programs by leveraging existing surveillance authorities, implementing established privacy safeguards, and maintaining transparent community communication protocols. This analysis provides the comprehensive legal framework examination and practical implementation tools necessary to navigate these multifaceted considerations effectively.

## **1\. Core legal framework analysis**

### **1.1. Legal Authorization**

Most jurisdictions implement WBS under broad public health surveillance powers rather than specific statutory authorization. For example, the United States CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System operates through congressional appropriations and existing public health authorities, while, similarly, the UK's Environmental Monitoring for Health Protection program functioned through inter-agency collaboration without new legislation.

The EU's revised Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (effective 2025\) creates the first explicit mandate for pathogen surveillance in sewage, requiring member states to monitor for antimicrobial resistance genes and epidemic viruses. Australia's National Wastewater Surveillance Program, announced in 2024, represents a policy-driven approach to systematic implementation.

When establishing WBS programs, practitioners should:

* Identify existing authorities: Review public health acts, environmental monitoring laws, and disease surveillance regulations for applicable powers  
* Document legal basis: Create formal memoranda outlining the legal foundation for WBS activities  
* Establish Inter-agency Agreements: Develop partnerships between health departments, environmental agencies, and water utilities  
* Consider Legislative Development: While not immediately necessary, advocate for explicit WBS provisions in future public health law reforms

### **1.2. Mandatory Reporting Requirements**

All analyzed jurisdictions maintain effective notifiable disease systems for clinical cases, but none extend mandatory reporting requirements to WBS findings (Clinical case reporting ≠ environmental surveillance reporting). This creates operational flexibility while maintaining public health responsiveness.

Successful programs establish voluntary data sharing protocols:

* United States: CDC NWSS operates through voluntary state participation with federal coordination  
* South Korea: KDCA publishes weekly WBS results as part of routine public health communication  
* Brazil: Academic-government partnerships share findings through institutional agreements

**Reporting Protocol Template** 

WBS Data Sharing Agreement Framework:

- [ ] 1\. Scope of data sharing (pathogens, geographic coverage, frequency)  
- [ ] 2\. Data quality standards and laboratory protocols  
- [ ] 3\. Communication triggers for public health action  
- [ ] 4\. Privacy protection measures and data anonymization  
- [ ] 5\. Roles and responsibilities of participating organizations  
- [ ] 6\. Data retention and destruction policies

**Implementation Guidance**

* Establish clear protocols for when WBS findings trigger public health investigation  
* Create standardized formats for sharing WBS data with health authorities  
* Develop decision trees for escalating concerning findings  
* Train laboratory staff on appropriate communication channels

### **1.3. Data Protection and Privacy**

Aggregated sewage data typically do not constitute personal information under major privacy frameworks (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA, LGPD, POPIA, etc). This legal consensus provides a strong foundation for WBS implementation without individual consent requirements.

**Privacy Safeguards by Scale**

| Catchment Size | Privacy Risk | Recommended Safeguards |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| \>50,000 people | Minimal | Standard data handling protocols |
| 3,000-50,000 people | Low | Avoid specific location identification |
| \<3,000 people | Moderate | Consider data aggregation or withholding |
| Institutional (dorms, individual facilities) | High | Require institutional agreement |

**Practical Privacy Framework**

- [ ] Conduct privacy impact assessments for new WBS programs  
- [ ] Develop data handling protocols that exceed legal requirements  
- [ ] Establish community communication strategies emphasizing anonymity  
- [ ] Create clear policies for data sharing with external researchers and entities

### **1.4. Public Health Integration**

WBS functions most effectively when integrated into existing surveillance infrastructure rather than operating as standalone programs:

**Routine Surveillance Integration**

* Embed WBS data into regular epidemiological reporting  
* Use sewage signals to guide targeted clinical testing  
* Integrate with laboratory networks and reporting systems  
* Link to public health response protocols

**Emergency Response Integration**

* Include WBS in pandemic preparedness plans  
* Establish rapid deployment protocols for outbreak investigation  
* Connect to emergency command structures  
* Develop communication channels for urgent findings

**Best Practice Framework**

Integration Checklist:

- [ ] Identify lead agency for WBS coordination  
- [ ] Map WBS data flows to existing surveillance systems  
- [ ] Establish data sharing agreements between agencies  
- [ ] Train epidemiologists in WBS data interpretation  
- [ ] Develop response protocols for WBS alerts  
- [ ] Create public communication strategies  
- [ ] Establish quality assurance programs

### **1.5. Indigenous and Community Rights**

Legal requirements for indigenous consultation vary significantly. The United States voluntarily excludes tribal community data from public dashboards, while other countries have minimal specific requirements but strong ethical imperatives for community engagement.

When WBS may affect Indigenous or vulnerable communities:

* **Early Engagement**: Consult community leaders before program initiation  
* **Transparent Communication:** Explain WBS methods, benefits, and limitations clearly  
* **Respect Sovereignty:** Acknowledge Indigenous data governance principles  
* **Collaborative Design**: Include community input in program design and implementation  
* **Benefit Sharing**: Ensure communities receive actionable information from WBS programs

**Community Engagement Protocol Template**

Phase 1: Initial Consultation  
\- Identify appropriate community representatives  
\- Present WBS proposal and answer questions  
\- Document community concerns and suggestions

Phase 2: Collaborative Planning  
\- Incorporate community feedback into program design  
\- Establish communication protocols and reporting formats  
\- Define roles and responsibilities

Phase 3: Ongoing Partnership  
\- Regular community updates on findings  
\- Periodic review of program effectiveness

\- Continuous improvement based on community feedback

### **1.6. Oversight and Ethics**

Most WBS programs operate as public health practice rather than research, avoiding complex ethics review requirements. However, programs should maintain high ethical standards regardless of regulatory classification.

Prior to initiating wastewater-based pathogen surveillance programs, comprehensive consideration and satisfaction of fundamental ethical criteria constitutes an indispensable prerequisite for ethically sound and socially acceptable implementation.

* **Beneficence and Non-maleficence Principles:** Ethical WBS implementation necessitates clearly defining the project's purpose while explicitly articulating the populations under study, ensuring that program architecture maximizes societal benefits while systematically minimizing potential harm to individuals or demographic groups. Project objectives must demonstrate rigorous alignment with relevant public health or social goals, thereby guaranteeing actionable outcomes predicated upon collected data analysis. Furthermore, program design must strive to minimize the burden imposed upon community members relative to alternative surveillance methodologies, recognizing that ethical practice requires demonstrating proportionality between surveillance intrusion and public health benefit.  
* **Distributive Justice Considerations:** Ethical surveillance programs must promote equity through designing implementation strategies that systematically avoid favoritism or systemic biases across demographic groups, while acknowledging and addressing limitations in representational adequacy, particularly regarding potential disparities affecting rural or underserved populations during data collection planning phases. Methodological approaches must prioritize population-level data aggregation to circumvent targeting or stigmatization of specific groups, thereby ensuring that surveillance benefits and burdens are distributed equitably across affected communities.  
* **Respecting Individual Privacy and Autonomy:** While recognizing that explicit consent mechanisms at population scales may prove practically infeasible, ethical implementation requires constructive public engagement strategies that ensure transparency and meaningful community inclusion throughout program development and implementation phases. Effective community communication must facilitate comprehensive awareness while fostering trust through transparent processes, necessitating close collaboration with local institutions that enables meaningful contribution to and validation of surveillance initiatives. Considerations of resolution and catchment size must inform data use protocols, while distinctions between quantitative and genomic analyses require careful evaluation of their respective implications for data application and privacy protection.  
* **Data Custodianship, Distribution, and Communication Frameworks:** Wastewater surveillance data represents a complex amalgamation of environmental, microbial, pathogen genomic, and potentially human-derived signals, necessitating interdisciplinary governance approaches that address overlapping informational layers through comprehensive stewardship models. Ethical practice requires embracing data custodianship rather than ownership paradigms, emphasizing collective responsibility, ethical stewardship, and shared governance mechanisms that meaningfully involve local communities, infrastructure partners, and research institutions in collaborative decision-making processes.Decisions regarding data utilization and reuse must occur through collaborative processes incorporating meaningful involvement of local institutions and communities, particularly within international and cross-cultural contexts where cultural sensitivities and sovereignty considerations assume heightened importance. Metadata standards must balance public health utility with privacy protection requirements, guided by ethical integrity principles rather than individual researcher control imperatives.  
* **Transparency and Accountability Mechanisms:** Comprehensive transparency requires maintaining public dashboards that provide regular publication of anonymized results, methodology documentation that clearly explains sampling and analysis methods to enable public understanding, community communication protocols that provide regular updates to affected populations, and stakeholder engagement processes that facilitate ongoing dialogue with community representatives and other interested parties.


  

**Ethics Review Decision Tree**

Is WBS generating data for:  
├─ Routine public health surveillance? → No ethics review required  
├─ Academic research publication? → Ethics review likely required  
├─ Commercial application? → Ethics review required  
└─ Novel methodology testing? → Ethics review recommended

### **1.7. Implementation Challenges**

**Unclear Legal Authority**

* The absence of specific WBS legislation in many jurisdictions creates interpretive challenges that can be addressed through developing comprehensive legal memoranda documenting existing authorities with sufficient specificity to provide operational clarity. Many programs successfully operate under general public health surveillance powers, demonstrating that specific legislation, while potentially beneficial, is not prerequisite to effective implementation.

**Inter-agency Coordination**

* The multidisciplinary nature of WBS necessitates coordination between health departments, environmental agencies, and water utilities, requiring formal agreements that clearly define roles, responsibilities, and data sharing protocols. The United Kingdom's multi-agency partnership model during COVID-19 demonstrates the effectiveness of collaborative approaches that leverage existing institutional strengths while avoiding bureaucratic inefficiencies.

**Data Sharing Restrictions**

* Regulatory restrictions on data sharing can be addressed through creating clear protocols that distinguish between personal and population-level data, recognizing that all analyzed jurisdictions treat appropriately aggregated sewage data as non-personal information that falls outside restrictive privacy frameworks.

**Community Resistance**

* Public concerns about privacy and surveillance can be addressed through proactive communication strategies that emphasize anonymity and public health benefits while maintaining transparency about program objectives and methodologies. Successful programs invest substantially in community engagement processes that build trust through transparency and demonstrate respect for community concerns.


**Liability and Quality Control**

* Establish clear quality assurance protocols for laboratory procedures  
* Document standard operating procedures and maintain accreditation  
* Consider professional liability insurance for laboratory operations  
* Develop clear communication protocols to avoid misinterpretation of results
