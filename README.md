# Wastewater Surveillance Guidance and Resources

Overview
========
This repository hosts guidance documents and resources developed by the [PHA4GE](https://pha4ge.org/) Wastewater Surveillance Working Group. These documents address core challenges involved in designing effective wastewater surveillance strategies, analyzing  wastewater pathogen sequencing and quantification data, and sharing this data with the global public health community. 

As the wastewater surveillance field rapidly progresses, it can be difficult to keep track of the current state-of-the-art methods and consensus practices. Our working group seeks to provide fully open and up-to-date best practice standards and protocols for the wastewater surveillance community via this live document repository. Alongside these documents, we also provide example case studies, examinations of published work in which wastewater and environmental surveillance has been deployed, and how this compares with our guidance. We welcome suggestions from across the wastewater research and public health community, please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section below for more information on how to contribute.
