At WWTPs, flow weighted composite sampling.   </li> <li>Reason for sampling method(s): The time-weighted sampling on campus was used to capture the average viral shedding over a day in small, well-controlled areas. Sampling was daily for residences and weekdays for other buildings to rapidly detect changes and transmission events. The main pump station at the Point Loma WWTP serves 2.3 million people. The flow-weighted sampling method accounted for daily fluctuations in wastewater flow, ensuring representative viral load estimates for the large population, and to provide a broad community snapshot of viral prevalence and variant trends over time.  </li> <li>Detection &amp; sequencing approach: qPCR-based detection, and viral load quantification at regional WWTPs. All SARS-CoV-2 positive samples sequenced.   </li> <li>How data will be used: Comparison of lineage prevalence in wastewater to those in clinical samples, determining that wastewater can detect emerging variants of concern up to two weeks earlier</li> </ul> <p>Ethical/Legal Considerations and Approvals: Core ethical considerations:</p> <ul> <li>Beneficience and non-maleficence: Wastewater surveillance was implemented in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, to monitor spread on the university campus, as well as the broader metropolitan area. Wastewater detections led to notifications for campus residents to test themselves, in order to identify and minimize virus spread in the community. Given the high density of university housing and facilities, building level surveillance enabled timely notification of individuals of nearby spread, without revealing any identifiable information. Community surveillance expanded variant tracking, while only using large regional wastewater catchments (&gt;&gt;100k individuals).   </li> <li>Distributive Justice: All residential and most academic buildings were monitored on campus, with no apparent biases. Community monitoring covered nearly the entire metro area in San Diego, using a catchment of &gt;2.3 million individuals.   </li> <li>Privacy and Autonomy: Campus surveillance, while performed at individual building resolution, was anonymous, and detection trends were made available (with clear community awareness and public health mandate) via a public web dashboard. Broader metro area trends were fully anonymized, and disseminated publicly via a web dashboard, in collaboration with county public health.   </li> <li>Data Custodianship, Distribution, and Communication: All raw data was made publicly available via NCBI SRA. Campus testing and wastewater testing and sequencing were made available in real time on web dashboards via public health and research institution partnerships.   </li> <li>Transparency and accountability: Separate public health dashboards were used for campus and broader metro area surveillance. On campus, individuals were notified if buildings that they lived in were known to have positive detections via wastewater. </li> </ul> <p>Core legal considerations:</p> <ul> <li>Legal authorization: Study was a collaboration among academic and public health (university and county), with a clear mandate to provide real-time surveillance to the community.   </li> <li>Mandatory Reporting Requirements: No legal reporting mandate specific to COVID-19.   </li> <li>Data Protection and Privacy: All data is de-identified and only simple positive/negative information is made available at the building level for campus surveillance, in line with the university public health mandate. Metro area surveillance focuses only on large catchment areas, ensuring anonymity of results.    </li> <li>Public Health Integration: Data was integrated directly into public health monitoring and dashboards, both at the university level and at the metro area level, in near real-time. Metro area results were also included in county public health weekly reports.   </li> <li>Community and Indigenous Rights: Campus surveillance was performed in close contact with community members and leadership, and did not specifically target any group. Metro area surveillance included all groups, including some indigenous communities, but was performed at a large-scale resolution, so that no group could be specifically identified or targeted from surveillance. </li> </ul> <p>Data Analysis: </p> <ul> <li>Virus diversity: richness was defined as the total number of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) called with iVar, and mean Shannon entropy calculated using an equation provided in the manuscript. Statistical associations were measured using a Mann-Whitney U-test.  </li> <li>Lineage abundance estimation: Freyja  </li> <li>Phylogenetic analysis: masking of homoplasic sites, followed by maximum likelihood reconstruction for each major Variant of Concern  </li> <li>Temporal delay detection: estimation of lag time between epidemiological curves from wastewater and clinical surveillance of the Epsilon variant</li> </ul> <p>Data Sharing Strategy: raw sequence data available on NCBI Sequence Read Archive under the BioProject ID PRJNA819090; consensus sequences available on GISAID; publicly available dashboards (https://returntolearn.ucsd.edu/dashboard/ ; https://searchcovid.info/dashboards/wastewater-surveillance/ ; https://searchcovid.info/dashboards/sequencing-statistics/)</p>"},{"location":"CaseStudy2-GuidanceDoc.html","title":"Blantyre Typhoid","text":"<p>Case Study #2 - \u201cEnvironmental surveillance for Salmonella Typhi in rivers and wastewater from an informal sewage network in Blantyre, Malawi\u201d</p> <p>The aim of the study was to assess the feasibility of utilising ES in an urban environment drained by a natural river system and investigate whether this approach might be a useful tool for confirming the presence and sustained transmission of S. Typhi within the local population.</p> <p>Surveillance Strategy/System Design: </p> <ul> <li>Sampling location: Blantyre, Malawi (metropolitan area)  </li> <li>Sampling sites: A combination of 41 river sites and 2 informal sewage channels. River sites selected based on broad geographic coverage, catchment population &gt;1,200, sufficient river flow, and safe and consistent accessibility. Catchment sizes ranged from 4000 to 30000 individuals.   </li> <li>Sampling frequency: Monthly between May 2021 and May 2022  </li> <li>Sample collection method: One litre water grab samples, collected in autoclavable PPCO bottles; composite sampling with the Moore swab, manufactured with sterile gauze and high-tensile braided fishing line  </li> <li>Reason for sampling method(s): The Grab Sample method provides a snapshot of pathogen presence at a single time point. Moore swabs are low-cost and potentially more sensitive to pathogen concentration and therefore its detection over time, and are suitable for turbid waters and intermittent pathogen shedding. Since Blantyre lacks formal wastewater systems, these two methods were chosen to evaluate if environmental surveillance using these methods could detect sustained Salmonella Typhi transmission in such natural water systems.  </li> <li>Detection &amp; sequencing approach: qPCR for S. Typhi-specific gene targets (ttr, tviB and staG); no sequencing  </li> <li>How data was used: Identification of local hotspots in resource-limited regions experiencing a high disease burden; comparisons with clinical incidence data from Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital</li> </ul> <p>Ethical/Legal Considerations and Approvals: Core ethical considerations:</p> <ul> <li>Beneficience and non-maleficence: Typhoid fever is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and this study aimed to pilot the use of ES for identification of high-burden regions for subsequent vaccination campaigns. The surveillance does not target or identify specific groups, and is purely used for identification of clinically under-monitored regions, and to guide vaccination strategy.   </li> <li>Distributive Justice: All of the Blantyre metro area was monitored, with sites selected to cover as much of the population as possible, leveraging available wastewater streams (rivers) and drainage ditches.   </li> <li>Privacy and Autonomy: Sites were selected to maximize catchment size, with a minimal catchment of 1200 individuals. Data was not provided in real time, as this represents a pilot effort to identify approach utility. Ethics approvals were obtained both from University of Malawi College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (COMREC) and Imperial College London Joint Research Compliance Office.   </li> <li>Data Custodianship, Distribution, and Communication: Only positivity data (binary) was generated, and all data (aggegated by month) was included in the publication.  </li> <li>Transparency and accountability: No public health dashboards or dissemination tools were used for this work.</li> </ul> <p>Core legal considerations:</p> <ul> <li>Legal authorization: This project was a primarily academic study, performed by Imperial College, Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome Trust, and Kamuzu Unviersity researchers, aimed at developing new strategies for public health surveillance and vaccination for S. typhi.   </li> <li>Mandatory Reporting Requirements: No legal reporting mandate specific to S. typhi. </li> <li>Data Protection and Privacy: All data is de-identified and only binary (positive/negative) information is available for monitored sites. Data is not publicly released, and aggregated for publication.   </li> <li>Public Health Integration: Data was used to compare with clinical case trends, and to inform future surveillance and vaccination efforts.   </li> <li>Community and Indigenous Rights: Surveillance efforts were performed with community approvals. All published data is aggregated across time, and catchment resolution is sufficient for general guidance of vaccination strategy, but prevents targeting of any specific population.</li> </ul> <p>Data Analysis:</p> <ul> <li>Associations between site and sample-level characteristics: sampling data analyzed separately for Moore swabs and grab samples by fitting univariant and multivariate mixed effects logistic regression models. Comparisons were performed to assess the impact of river vs sewage sites, HF183 copy number (indicator of fecal contamination) at different sites, sample- and site-specific factors such as river channel depth and stream velocity, and catchment population sizes on odds of S. Typhi detection.  </li> <li>Spatiotemporal trends: monthly cases plotted with monthly detection rates to identify trends in detection and correlation with hospital reported cases of typhoid fever.   </li> <li>Geographic visualization: QGIX v3.22.4 used to visualize 1) the spatial distribution of S. Typhi rates of detection, 2) fecal contamination, and 3) cumulative incidence rates of typhoid fever.</li> </ul> <p>Data Sharing Strategy: Data on sampling sites included as supplementary tables, available in aggregated form (e.g., by month) as word documents, but not in easily parseable. No raw data is available. </p>"},{"location":"CaseStudy3-GuidanceDoc.html","title":"Spain Mpox","text":"<p>Case Study #3 - \u201cSpanish wastewater reveals the current spread of Monkeypox virus\u201d</p> <p>The aim of the study was to trace the community circulation of the MPXV from potentially symptomatic, asymptomatic, or presymptomatic individuals using the previous established Spanish National SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater Surveillance Network (VATar COVID-19).</p> <p>Surveillance Strategy/System Design: </p> <ul> <li>Sampling location: 20 sampling locations throughout Spain  </li> <li>Sampling site: sewage (untreated wastewater) from wastewater treatment plants  </li> <li>Sampling frequency: weekly sample collection from 20 sites  </li> <li>Sample collection method: active; grab sampling  </li> <li>Reason for sampling method(s): The grab sample method, combined with the aluminum adsorption-precipitation method to concentrate the viral particles, was previously validated when Spain did WBE for SARS-Cov-2.  </li> <li>Integration with ongoing surveillance efforts: Built upon existing COVID-19 wastewater monitoring, and enables comparison of wastewater data and clinical trends from the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network (RENACE) in Spain.   </li> <li>Detection &amp; sequencing approach: qPCR testing only (MPXV generic and Clade II-specific), no sequencing.   </li> <li>How data will be used: Quantification of MPXV DNA in samples from different regions and comparison to clinical case counts </li> </ul> <p>Ethical/Legal Considerations and Approvals:</p> <p>Core ethical considerations:</p> <ul> <li>Beneficience and non-maleficence: Approach aims to enable earlier MPXV detection, including in asymptomatic individuals, potentially preventing ongoing transmission. Positives and trend information is resolved at the level of \u201cAutonomous Community\u201d regional level (comparable to a state or province), and does not have the potential to lead to stigmatizing of individuals or communities beyond what is already known clinically.   </li> <li>Distributive Justice: Approach is focused on large scale WWTPs, and does not bias towards particular areas or communities. It is, however, focused on urban areas, and does not directly monitor rural populations.    </li> <li>Privacy and Autonomy: Although explicit consent is not possible at this scale, the program is coordinated by the Institute of Agrochemistry and Food Technology, IATA-CSIC, a national public health research center run by the Spanish government. Catchment sizes are large, and all data collection is just qPCR-based quantification, with no sequencing performed.   </li> <li>Data ownership and usage: Data is owned by IATA, maintained by researchers, and not made available to the public, outside of specific government reports. Data is \u201cavailable on request\u201d, but not publicly available, with limited transparency and ease of access. Data is virus quantification based, and no sequencing data is generated. </li> </ul> <p>Core legal considerations:</p> <ul> <li>Legal authorization:Study is funded and overseen by the Spanish government, with direct interaction with the Spanish Ministry of Health, which has an explicit mandate for pathogen surveillance, including via sewage. The study is coordinated by leading public health institutions and universities, that are accountable and are deploying a proportional response that is clearly necessary to understand possible undetected Mpox spread.  </li> <li>Mandatory Reporting Requirements: No reporting mandate specific to MPXV, but results were transparent and reported regularly through Ministry of Health public health surveillance reports.   </li> <li>Data Protection and Privacy: All data is de-identified and results are aggregated at the regional level for reporting, and samples are collected from large wastewater treatment plants. No personal identifiers needed, since the project is purely focused on wastewater.   </li> <li>Public Health Integration: Wastewater analyses were directly incorporated into tracking and reporting for the MPXV outbreak, and disseminated through regular reporting from the Ministry of Health.   </li> <li>Community and Indigenous Rights: Data is robustly anonymized (by nature of wastewater sampling) and in line with European Union wastewater treatment directives, and sampling does not specifically target any group or sub-population. No specific engagement with community leaders was reported, but research produced actionable information that was broadly shared to community members.  </li> </ul> <p>Data Analysis Approach:  The study analyzed trends and regional differences in MPXV DNA prevalence in wastewater by region, using qPCR based virus abundance quantification. Trends were directly compared to numbers of confirmed clinical cases from the Spanish Ministry of Health. No bioinformatic analyses were used since sequencing was not performed. </p> <p>Data Sharing Strategy: Unfortunately, data is not publicly available, but may be available upon request to the corresponding authors.</p>"},{"location":"CaseStudy4-GuidanceDoc.html","title":"Bengaluru Multi-pathogen","text":"<p>Case Study #4 - Respiratory virus infection dynamics and genomic surveillance to detect seasonal influenza subtypes in wastewater: a longitudinal study in Bengaluru, India</p> <p>The aim of the study was to track the prevalence and evolution of common respiratory viruses [SARS Cov-2, Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV)]  in longitudinal wastewater surveillance in Bengaluru, India, using both qPCR-based quantification and a combination of amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. </p> <p>Surveillance Strategy/System Design: </p> <ul> <li>Sampling location: 28 sites within Bengaluru, India.  </li> <li>Sampling site: Influent wastewater from 28 centralized sewage treatment plants (STPs).

Associations between viral concentrations were measured using Kendall\u2019s tau statistic.  </li> <li>Influenza read processing and subtyping (first pipeline): Trimmomatic (v.0.39), Kraken (v.2.1.3), Bowtie2 (v.2.2.5), and SAMtools coverage/bedcov were used for quality control and mapping to an influenza genome database (https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/INFLUENZA/influenza.fna). Sample metadata from NCBI was used to annotate putative subtypes.   </li> <li>Influenza read processing and subtyping (second pipeline): iav_serotype (v.0.1.4) used for read processing and subtyping using an average nucleotide identity (ANI) approach.  </li> <li>SARS-CoV-2 variant detection: raw reads aligned with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (MN908947) using BWA, followed by single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling with iVar (versions not specified).   </li> <li>Lineage abundance: Freyja (version and barcode file not specified)</li> </ul> <p>Data sharing strategy: The preprint has a placeholder NCBI BioProject ID, suggesting that the authors plan to make the sequences publicly available eventually.

The following guidance document is primarily geared towards targeted (often capture probe or amplicon-based) sequencing of pathogens in wastewater, though we provide guidance for metagenomic analyses as well. </p> <p>To get started with analyzing your data, it may be helpful to first determine your level of experience and preferred computing environment. That is, if you are: </p> <ol> <li>Using existing bioinformatics pipelines (with command line experience)  </li> <li>Using existing bioinformatics pipelines (for non-bioinformaticians)  </li> <li>Doing custom pipeline development using existing tools  </li> <li>Doing custom tool development for wastewater-based analyses</li> </ol> <p>In this document we provide the necessary references and resources to get up and running while adhering to the current best practices for wastewater surveillance. </p> <p>Using Community-supported Bioinformatics Pipelines (Scenario 1 and 2) Many widely used workflows are already publicly available and standardized for use by the broader public health research community, for bioinformatics experts and non-bioinformaticians alike. </p> <p>Using existing community bioinformatics pipelines (Scenario 1) If you are comfortable running your own pipelines using tools such as Nextflow, snakemake, and/or bash, we recommend considering the following widely used approaches. </p> <p>Official Public Health Institute tools The following are workflows developed and employed by leading government agencies performing wastewater genomic surveillance, including US CDC. </p> <ul> <li>Aquascope is a \u201c bioinformatics best-practice pipeline for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, sequenced through shotgun metagenomic sequencing, from wastewater\u201d, developed by the US CDC. The package does all necessary read alignment and trimming, quality control, and provides lineage prevalence estimates using Freyja. Aquascope supersedes the now deprecated C-WAP project. </li> </ul> <p>STaPH-B Bioinformatic Toolkit The state public health bioinformatics (STaPH-B) consortium is dedicated to providing easy access to open-source bioinformatic software, without the need for local management and installation of package dependencies. </p> <ul> <li>Cecret  is an end-to-end workflow that can be customized to handle both clinical and wastewater SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data, originally developed by Erin Young (Utah PHL). Cecret accepts fastq inputs, performs alignment, trimming, consensus calling (not recommended in general for wastewater samples) and lineage prevalence inference with Freyja. Cecret is easily installed via the staph-b toolkit, which provides a docker container that can be used to run the Nextflow pipeline.</li> </ul> <p>Nf-core Nf-core (https://nf-co.re/)  is a collection of community maintained bioinformatics pipelines developed using the Nextflow workflow language. Nextflow provides seamless integration with Docker, Singularity, Conda and other container solutions, allowing pipelines to be deployed to a variety of computational settings and maintain reproducible results. </p> <ol> <li>nf-core/viralrecon is used for viral metagenomic sequencing to perform genome assembly and intrahost variant calling. The pipeline supports both Illumina and Nanopore sequencing data, typically obtained from shotgun sequencing (e.g. directly from clinical samples) or enrichment-based library preparation methods (e.g. amplicon-based: ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 enrichment protocol; or probe-capture-based).. For Nanopore data the pipeline only supports amplicon-based analysis obtained from primer sets created and maintained by the ARTIC Network. Certain steps (e.g. host read filtering, primer trimming) can be omitted, allowing the workflow to generalize well to different experimental approaches. Relevant to wastewater sequencing, viralrecon supports downstream analysis with Freyja.  </li> <li>nf-core/mag can be used to visualize the relative abundance of organisms in complex samples. It can use only short reads or a mixture of short and long reads to perform hybrid assembly.  </li> <li>nf-core/funcscan  is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline which currently features mining for antimicrobial peptides, antibiotic resistance genes and biosynthetic gene clusters. It performs the screening of contigs for antibiotic resistant gene-like sequences with ABRicate, AMRFinderPlus, fARGene, RGI, DeepARG.  </li> <li>nf-core/taxprofiler is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for taxonomic classification and profiling of shotgun short- and long-read metagenomic data. It allows for in-parallel taxonomic identification of reads or taxonomic abundance estimation with multiple classification and profiling tools against multiple databases, and produces standardised output tables for facilitating results comparison between different tools and databases.  </li> </ol> <p>For more information on the specific tools being used within these pipelines, we recommend you check out the Gold-Standard Methods for Wastewater Genomic Surveillance section. </p> <p>Resources for non-bioinformaticians (Scenario 2) If you are not interested in running your own analyses via the command line, you can still do the same analyses via drag and drop style web platforms. There are two commonly used platforms, Terra and Galaxy, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. </p> <ol> <li>Galaxy is an \u201copen source, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research\u201d. Galaxy is entirely free to use and allows users to choose from a curated list of workflows, but jobs may queue for extended periods, and workflows are broken into individual steps.   </li> <li>Quality control:   </li> <li>The US FDA has prepared an open source Wastewater QC workflow in GalaxyTrakr (SSQuAWK4), available via protocols.io.   </li> <li>For more general quality control, we recommend this tutorial from Batut et al. which provides step by step instructions and tips.   </li> <li>Read alignment and trimming: A handful of tutorials exist for doing alignment and trimming in Galaxy. We recommend considering this one from Wolfgang Meier and B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Batut.   </li> <li>Lineage Prevalence Inference:   </li> <li> <p>Freyja\u2019s core variant calling (variants) and deconvolution (demix) functions are available directly through Galaxy. </p> </li> <li> <p>Terra: Terra is a cloud computing platform that uses configurable workflow development language (WDL) workflows to perform end-to-end bioinformatic analyses. Workflows for use in Terra can be obtained freely via Dockstore, and is free to use for individuals, but cloud computing is performed via google cloud and can incur costs.  </p> </li> <li>Freyja_FASTQ: End to end pipeline to perform lineage prevalence estimation for SARS-CoV-2.  </li> <li>Freyja_Plot: Plots outputs from Freyja FASTQ/demix</li> </ol> <p>Custom pipeline development using existing tools (Scenario 3) If you are building your own pipeline based on current state of the art tools, we recommend doing so with common pipeline tools such as Nextflow and snakemake. Both Nextflow and snakemake contain standalone modules,  which can be used to execute individual processing steps. For Nextflow, nf-core/modules contains a large collection of standalone modules (i.e. workflow steps) used in other publicly available nf-core pipelines. This resource can serve as a useful starting point for building custom analysis pipelines tailored to your specific needs.</p> <p>Gold-Standard Methods for Wastewater Genomic Surveillance Depending on the sequencing approach used, researchers and practitioners should select the appropriate data processing and analyses to characterize their samples. The following are our recommended practices for analyses of targeted (e.g., amplicon-based sequencing) and non-targeted sequencing data (e.g. shotgun metagenomic sequencing). </p> <p>Data Pre-Processing Guidelines Quality Assessment and Control: Since the quality of raw sequencing data is extremely important in downstream wastewater sequencing data analyses, we strongly recommend evaluating read quality before performing any analyses. Read quality assessment should be performed regardless of the sample type, with a particular focus on mean per base quality score across reads, mean and standard deviation of the read length. For SARS-CoV-2, PHA4GE has provided some basic quality guidelines for sequencing data, which can be calculated using tools including FastQC and samtools. We note however that these QC parameters may not be appropriate for all sequencing platforms, samples, and pathogens, especially when considering pathogens like bacteria with large genomes.</p> <ul> <li>Read quality assessment:    FastQC can be used to measure the quality of the sequencing reads with both CLI and GUI options through Conda and Galaxy. You may find examples of good and bad quality reports for Illumina reads here.  </li> <li>PCR primer, sequencing adapter trimming:   Once the read quality is assessed, users should make sure to trim PCR primers and sequencing adapters with lower quality since these sequences have higher error rates. For trimming primers, tools such as iVar can be used by simply providing a primer bed file. It is available both through Conda and Galaxy and more information on iVar can be found here. To remove sequencing adapters and remove the contaminations, Bbduk can be used.  It is available both on Conda and Galaxy, for more information read this.   </li> <li>Implications and approaches needed for lower quality/higher error rate data</li> </ul> <p>Lineage Prevalence Inference Methods A handful of methods are used for the inference of lineage prevalence from wastewater sequencing data. Of these, Freyja is field standard and is the most widely used. We provide a description of each of the most commonly employed approaches in the field here, along with links to relevant papers and package repositories. To examine the differences between these methods we recommend considering (Sutcliffe et al. 2024; Ferdous et al. 2024; Kayikcioglu et al. 2023). </p> <ul> <li>Viral lineage quantification(VLQ)(Baaijens et al. 2021): A RNA transcript quantification method leveraging multi-lineage references using Kallisto transcript abundance quantification program. More information found in the publication and the GitHub repository, and a nextflow pipeline for VLQ is available here.  </li> <li>Freyja(Karthikeyan et al. 2022): A depth-weighted demixing method used to quantify lineage abundance in wastewater samples. Used in most standard wastewater analysis pipelines, including Aquascope and Cecret.

Two methods are currently available for doing this: </p> <ol> <li>SAM_Refiner collects information on linked mutations from a set of aligned reads, and removes chimeric sequences to improve the accuracy of variant calling.(Gregory, DA et al. 2021)</li> <li>Freyja\u2019s covariants function parses aligned sequencing reads for physically linked mutations, which can be queried against large public databases of clinical sequencing data, such as via Outbreak.info, to enable the detection of potential cryptic circulation of viral lineages in wastewater.(Gangavarapu et al. 2023) </li> <li>Crykey screens for rare linked mutations using a static database of observed SARS-CoV-2 genomes, allowing for detection of previously unobserved genomic variation(Liu et al. 2024).  </li> </ol> <p>Metagenomic Sequencing Methods Although metagenomic sequencing of wastewater has great potential for unbiased surveillance of diverse pathogens, wet-lab pathogen concentration protocols are not yet capable in general of obtaining significant read depth and coverage for many pathogens. In many cases, the vast majority of reads are associated with host and enteric bacterial reads, which are of minimal use for pathogen surveillance. However, some recent studies using virome hybridization capture panels have suggested that this sort of metagenomic surveillance may be possible. When working with this data, or other metagenomic wastewater sequencing data, we recommend the following tools: </p> <ul> <li>Kraken: Kraken is a widely used k-mer based match taxonomic classification tool that is used to classify reads to the most specific possible taxonomic label (genus,species, etc.), using the lowest common ancestor (LCA). (Wood, Lu, and Langmead 2019) </li> <li>Bracken: Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance after Classification with KrakEN, or Bracken, is used as a post-processing step after Kraken that leverages the small numbers of reads that may be able to distinguish between species present in a sample, even if the vast majority of multiple species\u2019 genomes are identical.(Lu et al. 2017) </li> <li>Sourmash: This tool is used for a variety of metagenomic analyses purposes such as identification of the reference genome for read mapping, sequence querying and taxonomic classification of reads.  </li> <li>Targeting of specific genes of interest  </li> <li>AMR markers: There is a continuous effort to develop methods for detection of antibiotic resistance through wastewater sequencing. For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis(MTB) drug resistance markers that have been catalogued by the World Health Organization and are most commonly detected using tb-profiler. </li> </ul> <p>Guidelines for researchers developing new tools (Scenario 4) Wastewater-based genomic pathogen surveillance, much like clinical genomic surveillance, relies on transparent accounting of the specific information (e.g., metadata, methods, libraries) used while performing an analysis. Enabling consistent and interpretable outcomes for bioinformatics analyses requires the use of standardized resources for sample analyses.  When building new tools for community use, we recommend that developers adhere to the following standards. These approaches maximize tool usability, transparency, reproducibility, and access across contexts.</p> <p>Index/Database Versioning Over the course of an outbreak, available information on circulating strains will often change on a daily basis, requiring public health researchers to integrate the most up-to-date sources of data possible. As such, it is important for analyses to be performed using real-time resources that are versioned and/or timestamped. We provide a few examples of this as examples:</p> <ol> <li>Kraken2, the popular metagenomic read classifier, provides dates and descriptions for each of the reference databases it provides(Wood, Lu, and Langmead 2019). They are openly available here.   </li> <li>Freyja maintains a separate Freyja-data repository to store previous barcodes and metadata needed to exactly reproduce results(Karthikeyan et al. 2022).   </li> <li>For lineage classification of virus genomes, PangoUShER is now the preferred approach(de Bernardi Schneider et al. 2024). The method relies on the global phylogenetic tree maintained by UShER, which is dated and publicly available here.(McBroome et al. 2021)</li> </ol>"},{"location":"DataAnalysis-GuidanceDoc.html#containerization","title":"Containerization","text":"<p>In order to ensure reproducibility and accessibility, wastewater workflows should ideally be containerized using standard container management systems (e.g. Docker, Singularity). Doing so allows for software dependencies to be packaged together with a workflow, ensuring that they can be run reliably regardless of the selected compute platform. </p> <p>Further, all containers should be made publicly available via container registries such as Docker Hub or Quay.io to ensure that software can be readily deployable and accessible for all public health researchers. </p> <p>As mentioned in the section concerning Index/Database Versioning, it is critical that analyses be performed with the most up-to-date resources possible as more information becomes available during the course of an outbreak. It is therefore advised to regularly build and push the most recent data to public container registries.</p> <p>Making tools available for non-bioinformaticians As many of the users of analysis packages, especially those used for pathogen surveillance, are not bioinformaticians and may require a click interface to analyze their data, it\u2019s important to consider development options that facilitate this. A few different standards exist, but the most commonly used is Workflow Description Language (WDL). </p> <p>We recommend making workflows available to the public via dockstore, which provides a user friendly interface that allows users to directly add the workflow to their computing resource of choice, including Terra and Elwazi. </p> <p>Analyses of Wastewater Pathogen Concentration Measurements Although wastewater sequencing data has the benefit of providing information on the specific mutations and lineages circulating in the population, estimates of the virus concentration in wastewater are often equally, if not more important to inform public health guidance. Using the appropriate analytical methods ensures proper interpretation of results, and is especially important for wastewater surveillance programs with multiple sites. </p> <p>Measurement normalization Since wastewater is a complex mixture that may be diluted by other contributing sources, it is important to perform proper normalization to ensure that measurements are comparable across sites and over time. In addition to measuring the concentration of the pathogen, it is important to also measure the concentration of a fecal indicator, with PMMoV or Crassphage being the most robust and highly shed in stool and urine. The resulting measurement is generally unitless, with pathogen concentration divided by indicator concentration. If an amplification control is available, it is often good practice to further scale by the estimated concentration of the amplification control.</p> <p>Since even normalized measurements can be difficult to compare across collection sites, we recommend performing statistical normalization of longitudinal samples (i.e. site specific mean-subtraction and variance scaling). However, it is worth noting that this approach requires sampling of the same site with the same collection and wet-lab techniques over an extended period of time, in which viral loads are able to vary over a considerable range. </p> <p>Aggregation of samples across sites To aggregate samples across sites, the catchment population and viral load are often used as a weighting factor to perform weighted averaging. Using a binning approach, samples can be grouped using the form average \\= sum(p*c)/sum(p), where c is generally the catchment population, or the product of the catchment population and normalized (and potentially standardized by site) viral load. </p> <p>Smoothing approaches for longitudinal data When analyzing sequential measurements, we recommend first considering basic convolutional smoothing filters, with moving average and binomial filters being the most commonly used. These simple smoothers are remarkably efficient, and can explicitly accommodate sample weighting by factors including catchment population. </p> <p>Local regression filtering, using methods including Savitzky-Golay or LOESS/LOWESS, can provide more effective smoothing but require more sophisticated implementations, and may be more difficult to interpret. When using these approaches, we recommend using 1st order polynomial approximations, in order to preserve signal norm.   </p>"},{"location":"DataSharing-GuidanceDoc.html","title":"Data Sharing","text":""},{"location":"DataSharing-GuidanceDoc.html#guidance-document-wastewater-data-sharing","title":"Guidance Document - Wastewater Data Sharing","text":"<p>Much like for clinical pathogen surveillance, sharing of wastewater quantification and genomic data is essential to enable timely and transparent public health responses, as well as more equitable access to health-related information across the globe. Sharing of pathogen data, in particular, requires careful accounting for the complex incentives and pressures, from academic to geopolitical, such that data is re-used only in line with submitter permissions. </p> <p>Wastewater provides a distinct type of genomic data that requires recording unique attributes to ensure data interpretability and re-use. For wastewater sequencing data, the appropriate data sharing platforms are also different, since assembled/consensus sequences poorly represent the complex pathogen mixtures present in wastewater.</p> <p>What wastewater data should I share?  In this section, we focus on sharing of combined quantification and sequencing wastewater data (at present, no repositories exist for sharing of only quantification data). As mentioned above, consensus sequences from wastewater are usually poorly defined, and consensus calling is highly likely to lead to incorrect genome characterization. We acknowledge that for pathogens with very low diversity, or samples with sufficient resolution (e.g., building level) to identify individual infections, consensus calling methods used for clinical surveillance are likely to be sufficient. In this case, we recommend following associated PHA4GE guidelines (https://pha4ge.org/sars-cov-2/), in addition to the steps described below. Wastewater sequencing data can be grouped into two main categories:</p> <ol> <li>Pathogen-specific: For pathogen-specific (e.g., amplicon or hybrid-capture based), we recommend sharing the raw reads that map to the reference of interest. Non-mapping reads can be discarded prior to sharing of read data.   </li> <li> <p>Read mapping can be performed using tools such as BWA (https://github.com/lh3/bwa) for Illumina reads, or minimap2 (https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) for ONT reads, against a reference genome of the target pathogen. These tools are often incorporated into existing bioinformatics workflows, many of which are listed in the Data Analysis section, for ease of use by non-bioinformaticians.</p> </li> <li> <p>Metagenomic: For metagenomic sequencing, both semi-targeted (e.g., multi-pathogen panels) and fully unbiased, we recommend removing all human reads by identifying reads that map to the hg38 genome, and excluding those from your sample.   </p> </li> <li>De-hosting can be performed using tools such as NCBI Human Read Removal Tool (HRRT) (https://github.com/ncbi/sra-human-scrubber) or Hostile (https://github.com/bede/hostile). These tools are often incorporated into existing bioinformatics workflows, many of which are listed in the Data Analysis section, for ease of use by non-bioinformaticians.</li> </ol> <p>After these filtering steps, remaining reads can then be shared either in fastq or bam format, and uploaded to the database of your choosing. </p> <p>Where to deposit wastewater data, and associated positives/negatives  Nearly all wastewater sequencing data that is shared is made available via openly accessible data repositories, primarily INSDC databases which includes NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA), the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). Data is shared across these databases, and any data uploaded to one INSDC database should be available through all of them. Whenever possible, we highly recommend that users upload to one of these databases, as they promote open data access and transparent analyses. </p> <p>However, we note that for many public health purposes, especially when considering monitoring of stigmatized pathogens and socioeconomic repercussions of data sharing, fully public data sharing may not be possible. At present, no such avenues for sharing of wastewater sequencing data are available. For samples where consensus sequence generation may be justified, GISAID and more recently Pathoplexus can be used for restricted-use data sharing. Both of these databases provide open sharing of data, with permanent or temporary options to enforce restricted use of the data by others. </p> <p>Metadata/Contextual data:  To ensure that wastewater data is re-usable and interpretable by others, we provide recommendations on the inclusion of basic attributes associated with the sample. These include information on the contributing catchment (e.g., population size, location), sample collection approach (e.g. grab, passive, composite), laboratory methods (e.g., sequencing platform), and other virus quantification (e.g., concentration of pathogen and fecal indicator for normalization).</p> <p>PHA4GE has developed a list of essential and optional contextual data fields for wastewater genomic surveillance(PHA4GE Wastewater Contextual Data Specification). This resource provides extensive discussion on the relevance of contextual data and its role in ensuring the utility of data for later analyses. </p> <p>Dissemination and communication While sharing of raw data is key to ensuring transparent and collaborative public health surveillance, perhaps the most important type of data sharing is sharing of results with stakeholders and the general public. One of the most effective ways to do this is to build a web dashboard that provides distilled data and visualizations. </p> <p>Depending on your needs, findings and visualizations can be inserted modularly into a web-page or as part of entirely separate dashboards. Although a number of approaches are used for dashboard development, two of the easiest and most flexible platforms are provided by the R Shiny and plotly dash packages. Both R Shiny and plotly dash are well documented, enable dashboard design directly in R/Python, and are easy to test and deploy without previous web programming experience. We provide a few example Dash based dashboards:</p> <ul> <li>NICD South African National Wastewater Dashboard: https://wastewater.nicd.ac.za/ </li> <li>SEARCH Wastewater Dashboard:https://searchcovid.info/dashboards/wastewater-surveillance/ </li> <li>Austrian Wastewater Dashboard: https://wavesdashboard.azurewebsites.net/</li> </ul> <p>As well as example R Shiny based dashboards:</p> <ul> <li>New York State Wastewater Surveillance Network: https://nywastewatcher.io/</li> <li>Dhaka Wastewater Surveillance: https://dhakaesforsars-cov-2.research.virginia.edu/</li> </ul> <p>Other commonly used dashboard development tools are PowerBI, Tableau, and ArcGIS, which tend to be primarily used for simple visualizations, such as longitudinal measurement of wastewater viral loads. While easy to develop, well-suited to geographic data, and requiring even less programming experience, these options offer far less flexibility in terms of the design and complexity of the analyses that can be shown on the dashboard. Example wastewater dashboards using these platforms include:</p> <ul> <li>Chicago Department of Public Health Wastewater Surveilllance (PowerBI): https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/covid-19-wastewater-surveillance.html </li> <li>Oregon Respiratory Viral Pathogen Wastewater Monitoring Dashboard (Tableau): https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.public.health.division.acute.and.communicable.disease.pre/viz/OregonsRVPWastewaterMonitoring/Mainpage</li> <li>Minnesota Wastewater Surveillance(ArcGIS, original - discontinued): https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/fd0350c812334c5f9733ca5b6186db0d </li> </ul>"},{"location":"EthicsAndLegality-GuidanceDoc.html","title":"Ethics & Legality","text":""},{"location":"EthicsAndLegality-GuidanceDoc.html#ethics-and-legality-of-wastewater-pathogen-surveillance","title":"Ethics and legality of wastewater pathogen surveillance","text":"<p>The legal concept of wastewater, while exhibiting variations in its precise definitional parameters and wording across jurisdictions, demonstrates remarkable consistency across regulatory frameworks in environmental and public health statutory instruments. The contemporary legal definitions encompass \"water that has been adversely affected in quality by anthropogenic influence,\" a formulation that necessarily encompasses domestic sewage originating from residential and institutional sources, industrial effluent discharged through commercial operations, urban stormwater runoff precipitated by meteorological events, and, within certain regulatory contexts, specialized waste streams including sludge and greywater systems.</p> <p>Wastewater can be used for a broad range of public health monitoring purposes, including tracking of the prevalence and evolution of pathogen species via wastewater. Over recent years, wastewater monitoring has most commonly been used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 trends, and has been shown to enable surveillance of a broad range of pathogens and in a variety of contexts, from large urban environments to the level of individual buildings. As these represent a wide range of use cases that provide correspondingly diverse information about the population of interest, it is essential to consider the unique ethical and legal considerations of different surveillance approaches.</p> <p>International legal instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), enshrine fundamental principles that guide surveillance practices, including the protection of individual privacy under Articles 12 and 17, respectively, ensuring that surveillance practices do not undermine human rights and ethical standards.bIn the context of public health surveillance, the WHO Ethical Guidelines for Public Health Surveillance (2017) further elaborate on these principles, emphasizing that surveillance must be necessary, proportionate, and publicly accountable. These guidelines stress that data collection methods must serve legitimate public health objectives, be justified by significant benefits, and include safeguards to prevent misuse or unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p> <p>Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) operates within a legal landscape characterized not by prohibitive regulatory barriers, but rather by a complex matrix of regulatory lacunae that, paradoxically, facilitates rather than impedes implementation. Our comprehensive analysis encompassing ten major jurisdictions reveals that the absence of specific WBS legislation, rather than constituting an impediment, has enabled jurisdictions to implement comprehensive surveillance programs through the strategic deployment of existing public health authorities. Privacy considerations, while frequently articulated as potential impediments to WBS implementation, have proven largely unfounded upon rigorous legal analysis. Aggregated sewage data, by virtue of its inherent anonymization and population-level aggregation, typically fails to satisfy the definitional requirements for personal information under established data protection regimes, thereby obviating individual consent requirements while maintaining compliance with privacy legislation. Public health practitioners can therefore proceed with confidence in establishing WBS programs by leveraging existing surveillance authorities, implementing established privacy safeguards, and maintaining transparent community communication protocols. This analysis provides the comprehensive legal framework examination and practical implementation tools necessary to navigate these multifaceted considerations effectively.</p>"},{"location":"EthicsAndLegality-GuidanceDoc.html#1-core-legal-framework-analysis","title":"1.

When determining the sampling location, there are some key considerations:</p> <ol> <li>Population of interest    Some wastewater surveillance systems target the population of an entire nation. For example, the South African Collaborative COVID-19 Surveillance System (SACCESS) network, established in 2021 for SARS-CoV-2 WBE, demonstrated increasing trends in SARS-CoV-2 concentration on the precipice of successive waves of the pandemic in the population of South Africa (Iwu-Jaja et al, 2023). In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established a National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS), which monitors SARS-CoV-2 and MPXV in sewersheds representing 47% of the US population (Adams et al, 2024).    </li> </ol> <p>Other wastewater surveillance systems are more narrow in scope, focusing on the population of individual cities, states, or neighborhoods. For example, a collaboration between UK HSA and WHO focused on detection of poliovirus in London, resulting in positive detections in a catchment area of 3 million people and allowing for a more targeted public health intervention (Klapsa et al, 2022). Also, a wastewater surveillance program in Louisville, Kentucky, USA successfully monitored city-wide trends in SARS-CoV-2 concentration, as well as the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, which enabled targeted deployment of public health resources (Rouchka et al, 2021). Narrowing the geographic region often allows for more direct public health action. This can be particularly beneficial in lower-resource settings where funding can be allocated to the specific population in need of intervention.  </p> <p>There are also wastewater surveillance systems that target a population living in a specific facility or encampment, or traditionally under-surveilled regions. When setting up a wastewater surveillance system, the locations selected for sampling should reflect this population of interest.</p> <ol> <li>Representativeness of population    Another consideration is whether the sampling location is representative of the population of interest. For example, when setting up a country-wide surveillance system, sampling locations should be distributed throughout the country in order to most appropriately represent the entire population of that country. Similarly, if the target population is a specific city, locations should be as representative of the entire city population as possible. In 2022, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health established a SARS-CoV-2 wastewater pilot study, where they selected wastewater treatment facilities in locations representing the major population centers in the country, Oslo (n=2), Bergen (n=4), Trondheim (n=2), and Troms\u00f8 (n=3) (Amato et al, 2023).</li> </ol> <p>Sampling site The sampling site is where wastewater samples are collected as part of the wastewater surveillance program. When determining the sampling site, there are some key considerations:</p> <ol> <li>Type of site </li> <li>Untreated wastewater - this includes waste from buildings (toilets, sinks, etc), environmental sources (rainwater), and industrial waste. Samples can be collected from the wastewater treatment plant influent, or upstream in the network based on the question of interest. Untreated wastewater sampling is ideal when wastewater treatment plants apply disinfectant before sludge can be sampled, sludge testing demonstrates high assay inhibition or poor virus recovery, or solids residence time within the primary clarifier is unknown (CDC, 2024)  </li> <li> <p>Primary sludge - this includes the suspended solids from the sedimentation process during the first phase of wastewater treatment. Virus concentrations tend to be higher in primary sludge, so this is often the recommended sample type when the case burden in the target population is low (CDC, 2024)</p> </li> <li> <p>Representativeness of site</p> </li> </ol> <p>When determining which site is most appropriate, the target population within the selected location should be the primary consideration. For example, with a target population of an entire neighborhood, if sampling untreated wastewater, influent would be most appropriate as it would capture all waste coming into the plant. It is also possible to calculate the number of individuals represented by a particular wastewater treatment plant to assist with evaluating representativeness of a population (Stikkers, 2022). However, there are also wastewater surveillance programs with a more targeted population, such as travelers during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, the CDC Ginkgo Bioworks monitoring program sampled aircraft wastewater following international flights across the Atlantic in 2022 (Morfino et al, 2023). In many contexts where wastewater transport networks are not available, it may be necessary to leverage information about local environmental flows and surface waters to identify good sampling sites (e.g., McQuade &amp; Blake et al. 2023). The use of tools including es.world allow for local topography, bodies of water, and population density to be used to ensure sampling sites are broadly representative. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Uniformity across sites</p> <p>When collecting wastewater samples from multiple sites, it is important to ensure uniformity in sample type to enable direct comparison. For example, virus concentrations between untreated wastewater and primary sludge cannot be directly compared as primarily sludge will inherently have higher concentrations. Additionally, different wastewater treatment facilities might use different methods during or following the sedimentation process that involve chemicals capable of interfering with laboratory methods. </p> </li> <li> <p>Pathogen-specific considerations</p> </li> </ol> <p>The ideal sampling site may differ depending on the pathogen of interest. For pathogens where the expected concentration in stool is low, such as influenza (need ref), primary sludge might be most appropriate. Similarly, for instances where the case burden is low, such as influenza during non-influenza season, or emerging strains that aren't widespread in the population yet, primary sludge might also be most appropriate. There are also pathogens that are shed in urine, such as Arboviruses, where untreated wastewater would be a preferred sampling site as it would also include liquid waste (Lee et al, 2022).</p> <p>An additional pathogen-specific consideration revolves around the need to apply mitigation efforts following detection. For pathogens with widespread community transmission, such as SARS-CoV-2, this is less relevant. However, for pathogens like Polio, identifying where infected individuals reside is critically important to public health.</p> <p>Sampling Frequency Frequency of sampling has two core components, the number of samples collected and how often samples are collected, both of which will depend on the purpose of the wastewater surveillance program.</p> <ol> <li>Point-prevalence vs longitudinal prevalence    The frequency of sampling is entirely dependent on the goals of the surveillance program and resource availability. In order to monitor trends over time, samples should be collected incrementally from the same sites throughout the study period, and more frequent sampling will result in more granular trend levels. In contrast, if establishing point prevalence is the primary purpose, samples only need to be collected once. However, the conclusions that can be drawn from point prevalence studies are often limited without additional context, or a \u201cbaseline\u201d from which to determine whether the prevalence at any given time is expected.  </li> </ol> <p>Monitoring trends over time, and therefore sampling routinely, is helpful for determining the amount of a particular pathogen circulating in the community, as well as certain genotypes of that pathogen. This is commonly applied to seasonal pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and RSV. It can also be helpful for evaluating the impact intervention measures on community transmission of a given pathogen. Point prevalence studies, or those simply detecting the presence or absence of certain pathogens or genes, may include studies attempting to characterize the resistome of wastewater samples (Huijbers et al, 2020;Talat et al, 2023). They can also be used to assess the efficacy of mitigation or distinfection efforts, including studies measuring abundance of pathogens or genes during different stages of the wastewater treatment process (Che et al, 2019; Rodriguez et al, 2021).  </p> <ol> <li>Sample sizes and frequency of collection    Similar to surveillance strategies using clinical specimens, larger sample sizes and more frequent sample collection can result in the identification of trends with higher levels of confidence. However, the relevance of sample size and frequency of sampling will ultimately depend on the purpose of the wastewater surveillance program.   </li> </ol> <p>For point-prevalence studies, frequency of sampling may not be relevant, but a larger sample size may provide a more narrow margin of error around the prevalence estimate and improve the overall robustness of conclusions. Similarly, larger sample sizes can reduce potential biases that are often introduced from data containing only a few samples, such as chance findings, and can broaden the impact of conclusions. This issue often arises in studies or public health programs designed to characterize the microbial community or \u201cresistome\u201d from wastewater samples. When a particular species or gene is detected in a single sample at a single point in time, it can be challenging to have confidence in those findings and apply them in a public health context.</p> <p>When evaluating trends over time, both sample size and frequency of sampling play a role in the ability to measure how the prevalence of a particular pathogen, gene, or variant is changing. Many national wastewater surveillance programs for respiratory viruses involve the collection of multiple samples from multiple sites every week, the results of which are aggregated into a single analysis to maximize public health impact. Importantly, if one of the aims of the wastewater surveillance program is to serve as an \u201cearly warning\u201d system for increased community transmission, frequent sampling is essential. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Pathogen-specific considerations</p> <p>When the pathogen, gene, or variant of interest is rare in the target population, larger sample sizes and frequent sampling are necessary and will increase the likelihood of detection. For slow growing organisms, and those with a lower basic reproductive number, there is likely to be a delay between the onset of disease in a population and detection in wastewater. More frequent sampling will allow for greater time resolution to determine when a pathogen of interest may have been introduced into a community.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Sample Collection Methods There are many well-established methods for collecting wastewater samples, but the optimal method will be largely dependent on the purpose of the wastewater surveillance program as well as time and resource availability.  </p> <ol> <li>Active vs passive </li> <li> <p>Active sampling is the manual process of a scientist collecting samples at the sampling site. While often cost-effective for point-prevalence studies and short-term wastewater surveillance studies, they can become time and resource-intensive for studies and programs that are longer in duration. Active sampling can involve the collection of grab or composite samples.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Passive sampling has become a fundamental approach to sample collection for wastewater surveillance programs that aim to monitor long-term trends, as it does not require scientists to be present. This involves a passive sampler device, of which there are several designs, that collects samples over a period of time (Schang et al, 2021). In addition to saving time, this also reduces potential bias that might be introduced from manual sampling efforts.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Grab vs composite </p> </li> <li> <p>Grab samples are collected at a single point in time. This sampling method is quick and does not require automated equipment, so this method may be advantageous for surveillance programs that require a quick turnaround time from sampling to dissemination of results. However, daily fluctuations in the flow of wastewater at the sampling site might vary and impact the ability to draw conclusions about trends over time. Also, if the disease burden in the target population may impact the utility of this sampling method, as it would be more difficult to detect lower concentrations of the pathogen or gene target in a grab sample that does not represent the entirety of the microbial population in wastewater.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Composite samples are pools of multiple grab samples collected at a specific frequency over a specific time period. This method often results in a more comprehensive sample that is representative of the entire target population, however, it is often more resource-intensive than grab sampling. Previous studies have found strong correlations in SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations between grab and composite samples, but the representativeness of composite samples might be a preferred approach for monitoring trends over a long time period.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Sequencing</p> <p>Sequencing of wastewater samples has been transformative for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance worldwide, but ultimately the decision to sequence and the most appropriate approach will depend on the target pathogen, purpose of the wastewater surveillance program, and resource availability. </p> <ol> <li>Determining whether to sequence </li> </ol> <p>Wastewater sequencing is particularly valuable for surveillance programs that aim to measure the abundance of certain genotypes of a pathogen with high levels of community transmission. Wastewater sequencing is frequently applied to SARS-CoV-2, whereby the abundance of Pango lineages in wastewater samples can be readily determined and serve as an indicator of what is circulating in the population of interest. Similarly, wastewater sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 can provide an early indication of when, where, and how quickly a particular lineage is emerging. SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequencing can also be used to evaluate whether the lineages circulating in the community are the same as those in clinical cases. Those results can be used to determine whether WGS-based surveillance is actually capturing the intended population, and inform insights into potential clinical severity associated with particular lineages.  For pathogens with low mutation rates, wastewater sequencing may not provide the same value as most of the sequence data would look the same. Similarly, for pathogens that do not have epidemiologically or clinically relevant genotypes, sequencing might not yield actionable information. It should also be noted that wastewater sequencing is more expensive than enumeration, and requires additional time, labor, and compute resources to maximize utility of the data. However, for many wastewater surveillance programs, the value added by sequencing far outweighs the cost to generate those data. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Sequencing approaches </p> </li> <li> <p>Metagenomics - metagenomic sequencing can be used to characterize the microbial community in wastewater.  A traditional shotgun metagenomics approach can be used for taxonomic profiling of the entire microbial community, or a targeted metagenomics approach can be used for selective sequencing of a particular pathogen or gene.   </p> </li> <li>Amplicon-based - amplicon sequencing targets specific regions of the genome of a particular pathogen. \u201cAmplicons\u201d refer to those regions of the genome that are amplified by the primers. This is a very common approach to wastewater sequencing of SARS-CoV-2.  </li> <li>Hybrid capture - a hybrid capture approach uses probes to capture specific genomic regions for sequencing. This is often applied to groups of microbes, such as respiratory pathogens, or the human virome (Kantor et al, 2024). </li> </ol> <p>Integration with ongoing surveillance efforts</p> <p>Integration of wastewater surveillance with concurrent epidemiologic and genomic surveillance efforts provides crucial context to the pathogen, gene, or variant of interest. The importance of this integration is very apparent with SARS-CoV-2, where viral concentration in wastewater is an indicator of community transmission levels. However, when combined with traditional epidemiologic data such as hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and COVID-19 mortality rate, this can provide insight into the clinical severity and associated public health impacts. Similarly, wastewater sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 can provide essential information on which particular variants are circulating in the community. When combined with sequencing of clinical specimens, it can illuminate potential differences in variant prevalence between SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the community, often through asymptomatic transmission, and SARS-CoV-2 that results in clinical cases. Similar approaches have been applied to other respiratory viruses such as influenza and RSV. </p> <p>Combining wastewater surveillance data with other surveillance programs can also help identify hotspots for a particular pathogen, and detect ongoing transmission in locations where clinical cases have not been identified. This was seen during the worldwide Mpox outbreak in 2022, whereby wastewater monitoring assisted epidemiologists in estimating the case burden of Mpox. Solely relying on clinical reporting resulted in underestimations of case counts due to reluctance to seek treatment by infected individuals, and over-estimations of disease severity by only counting those ill enough to seek treatment. </p>"},{"location":"SurveillanceStrategies-GuidanceDoc.html#available-resources-for-designing-a-wastewater-surveillance-strategy","title":"Available resources for designing a wastewater surveillance strategy:","text":"<ul> <li>CDC - Developing a Wastewater Surveillance Sampling Strategy https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/sampling.html </li> <li>APHL - SC2 WW surveillance guide https://www.aphl.org/aboutAPHL/publications/Documents/EH-2022-SARSCoV2-Wastewater-Surveillance-Testing-Guide.pdf </li> <li>National Academy of Sciences - setting up a national surveillance system https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK591717/ </li> <li>The international cookbook for wastewater practitioners https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC138489</li> </ul>"}]}
